# ESP32-Onenet MQTT
This Demo can make the ESP32 development board connect to the mobile Onenet cloud platform through the old version of MQTT (non-MQTTS) protocol after connecting to WiFi, and realize data upstream publishing and user downstream command subscription. The program is written in C language and published with Arduino software. For the library, see the Libraries archive.
